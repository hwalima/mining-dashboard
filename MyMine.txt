2.	Data Management
•	Comprehensive CRUD operations
•	Forms for entering production data
•	Forms for entering mining resources like equipment and chemicals
•	Bulk data import/export (CSV, Excel, PDF)
•	Data validation and sanitization
•	Soft delete functionality
3.	Dashboard & Visualization
•	Customizable dashboard widgets
•	Interactive charts and graphs
•	Real-time data updates

Technology Stack:
Frontend:
•	Framework: React (with TypeScript)
•	State Management: 
o	React Context API
o	Redux Toolkit (for complex state)
•	UI Library: Material UI
•	Charting: Recharts
•	Additional Libraries: 
o	React Hook Form (form management)
o	React-PDF (PDF generation)
o	SheetJS (Excel export)
o	Framer Motion (animations)
Backend:
•	Language: Python
•	Framework: Django
•	Additional Libraries: 
o	Django Rest Framework
o	Django GraphQL
o	Celery (background tasks)
o	Django Channels (WebSocket)
o	Django Simple History (audit trails)
Database:
•	Primary: SQLite
•	Caching: Redis
•	ORM: Django ORM with SQLAlchemy for complex queries
i will be using SQLite. based on your knowledge of a small scale to medium scale gold mining entity, suggest the tables i need and the schema. pardon me, i i asked the wrong thing, i have no idea on SQLite these are some of the tables i saw in another app which was using PostgreSQL, lets get some ideas from them. because i saw how effective the mining management app was. some of the tables fields can be calculated. for example, an ability to know the daily profit or loss will be based on the total gold produced for the day, minus all the expenses. energy consumption should have a cost component to it, since it is an expense. these are just examples. use them and your own experience to create the best the tables i saw:  dailychemicalsused dailycrushedstockpile  dailydepartmentalrequisitions dailydrillingblastingdata dailyenergyconsumption  dailyexplosivesused  dailygravelcrushed dailymachinerytimes  dailymilledstockpile dailygoldmillingequipmentrunningtimes dailyoperationalefficiency  dailyreportssummary  dailytonnagecrushed dailytonnagehoisted  dailylabourcostperdeparment  environmentalimpact  explosivecomponents  goldrecoveryrates  heavymachinery  injuriesrecordedperday  goldmillingequipment  miningchemicals  miningdepartmentcomments  miningdepartments  miningsites  profitabilityAnalysis  rolepermissions  smeltedgold  stockpilebalance  typeofinjuries  userroles users
